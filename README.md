TrackCorona will be an Android application that will enable users to view the latest news on the COVID-19 outbreak in their local areas and on a global scale. In the application, there will be visualizations provided using the latest statistics on COVID-19 displaying various outbreaks around the world. Particularly, for the United States, I wish to develop density heat maps based on the user's current location, illustrating the severity of the Coronavirus outbreak in their area. I will accomplish this by getting the accurate latest statistics from [Coronoavirus COVID19](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest), [Coronavirus Public Health Initiative](http://coronavirusapi.com/), and other Coronavirus statistic APIs. I will also include accurate local news based on the user's location using [Covid-19 Stats and News](https://www.programmableweb.com/api/smartable-ai-covid-19-stats-and-news-rest-api-v10). I plan to use the [Google Maps Android Heatmap Utility](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/utility/heatmap) and [Android Plot](http://androidplot.com/) libraries to help with my visualizations.
